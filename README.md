# Advanced Algorithms Assignment 1

### Scenario: Matching Socks

A merchant has a big pile of socks she wants to pair up and wants keep in a pile as organized pairs. Pairing up the
socks is based on their color (two socks of the same color will be paired up).

### Interpretation

The total number of socks in the pile is represented as an array of different colored socks. The matchingSocks function
returns the number of pairs of matching socks. The socks with no matching colors will be discarded.

### For example;

```
number of socks: 10 
array of colored socks[10] = {1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 4, 1, 3} 
pairs returned: 4
```

**_Point to note: We have come up with 1 pair of color 1, 1 pair of color 2, 1 pair of color 3, and 1 pair of color 4
hence 3 pairs._**

## Tasks to be completed:

1. Write down the **_pseudo-code_** for the algorithm that will solve the problem.
2. Find the **_time complexity_** of the algorithm based on the pseudo-codes.
3. Implement **_the algorithm_** in a programming language of your choice.
4. Finally, the program will be **_tested_** on some inputs and present the outputs.

## Deliverables

1. A _pdf or a doc file_ will be submitted covering the **_pseudo-code_** and the **_time complexity_** of the
   algorithm.
2. _Code_ will be submitted on GitHub. The **_GitHub file(s) link_** will be added to the pdf or doc file presented
   above.
3. Testing _results_ will be explained in the **_document_**
